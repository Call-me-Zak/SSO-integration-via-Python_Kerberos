** Implementation Plan
1. Configure Django for Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA)

    Set Up Active Directory (AD) Integration:
        Ensure your Django app is integrated with the companyâ€™s Active Directory.
        Install the necessary libraries, such as django-auth-ldap or django-kerberos, which will allow your Django application to communicate with AD.
